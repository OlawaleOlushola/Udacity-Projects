# Data Wrangling
> The aim of this project is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data and create an interesting and trustworthy data visualization

## Dataset

> We have three datasets in this project
>  1. twitter_achive_enhanced.csv  - contains information about dogs and it was downloaded manually
>  2. image_predictions.tsv - contains tweet image prediction of dogs and it was downloaded programatically using the request library
>  3. tweet_json.txt - includes tweets about dogs, favorite count, retweet counts, and other data that was retrieved from the Tweeter API

## Data Wrangling

>  Through visual assessment and programmatic inspection, we identify and record eight quality issues and tidiness. After that, such issues were resolved

## Summary of findings
> - The top rated dog's name is 'Bo' with a retweet count of 3,438 and favorite count of 82,436
> - 2016 accounts for the highest percentage of dog tweet over the three year period analysed
> - The number of retweets and favorite count have a strong positive correlation, which implies that the more a post is retweeted, the more viewers it receives and the more likes it gets
