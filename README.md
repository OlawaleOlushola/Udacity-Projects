# Udacity-Projects

All of the Udacity projects I successfully completed for the Nanodegree program are included in this repository.

- DATA ANALYST NANODEGREE (DAND) : Through ALX scholarship program
  - Project 1: Investigate a dataset: Analyse and then communicates the findings 
  - Project 2: Wrangle and Analyze Data: Analyze the WeRateDogs tweet data, which rates people's dogs along with a humourous remark about the dog
  - Project 3: Communicate Data Finding: In this project, data visualization is primarily used to explore the dataset related to flight cancellations and delays, and exploratory visualizations are then used to present the results
